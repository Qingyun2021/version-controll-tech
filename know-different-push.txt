1) ★★★  generally most often used one is "git push" command
	git push
	use it, if you already set up a tracking relationship 
	between your current branch and the remote branch

2) git push -u origin main
	use it, when you first time set up your branch
	That -u option told Git:
	"Hey, from now on, link my local main branch to the remote origin/main branch."

3) git push origin
	Pushes all matching branches from your local repo to the origin remote.
	e.g.
	I have branch b1, b2, b3, their up-stream branch is origin.
	after using git push origin, all the stored changement in the local repository
	of b1,b2,b3 will be sent to origin

4) git push origin branchName
	Pushes a specific branch to the origin remote.
	e.g. git push origin b1 
	as result, only changement of b1 will be sent to remote origin branch.
